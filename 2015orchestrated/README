This directory contains Auryn classes and simulations to reproduce on-line
learning with orchestrated plasticity rules.


Auryn classes

P10Connection 
	Implements the excitatory connection object for orchestrated
	plasticity without homeostatic sliding threshold.

P11Connection 
	Implements the excitatory connection object for orchestrated
	plasticity with homeostatic sliding threshold.

P12Connection 
	Implements variation of P11Connection with two limits of the
	sliding threshold.


Simulation files: 
	sim_rc_p10c: Recurrent network simulation with P10Connection
	sim_rc_p10d: Feedforward simulation with P10Connection
	sim_rc_p11:  Recurrent network simulation with P11Connection
	sim_rc_p12:  Recurrent network simulation with P12Connection

To compile these files modify the first lines in the makefile to point to your
auryn dev files and library. The current Makefile assumes that you have a
standard auryn directory under $(HOME)/auryn.
Then run make in the current directory.
